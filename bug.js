```javascript
// Example code with Tailwind classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">This is a title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

**Problem:** The Tailwind classes in the above code are not applied.

**Possible Reasons:**

1. **Missing or incorrect Tailwind setup:** Make sure you've installed Tailwind correctly and configured it in your project's CSS file. Check the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) to ensure the correct paths are set for your content files.
2. **Incorrect import:** The Tailwind CSS file may not be imported correctly in your main CSS file or component.
3. **Missing `@apply` directive:** For some Tailwind features, the `@apply` directive may be required. However, this is less common in newer versions of Tailwind.
4. **CSS specificity issues:** Other CSS rules might have higher specificity and override your Tailwind classes. Inspect your browser's developer tools to check which styles are actually being applied.
5. **Typographical errors:** Double-check for typos in your Tailwind class names.
6. **Conflicting CSS frameworks:** If you are using other CSS frameworks alongside Tailwind, there might be conflicts.  Try disabling other frameworks to isolate the issue.
7. **Purge not configured correctly:** If using the PurgeCSS plugin in production, ensure it's correctly configured to include your component files. Missing files in the purge configuration might lead to missing CSS classes.
8. **Caching issues:** Sometimes, browsers or build processes cache old CSS.  Try clearing your browser's cache, and if you're using a build process, rebuild your project.
9. **Incorrect build process:** If you have a complex build process, there could be an issue preventing Tailwind CSS from being included correctly.
